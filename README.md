# Automated-covid-bouncer
This project aims to develop an automated electronic bouncer for a restaurant that controls patrons’ entrance to, and exit from the restaurant. The bouncer is installed at the restaurant’s entrance door, keeps track of the number of people in the restaurant, and manages a queue system for people who want to enter the restaurant.
